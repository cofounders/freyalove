<h2>What’s so great about FreyaLove?</h2>

<p>Other dating sites only perform simple matches based on characteristics and physiology questions such as age, income, height, etc. As a result, most other sites are really no more than dating services where quality suffers. FreyaLove is unique. We provide an online match making service exclusively to single lesbians to help them find love in a better and fun manner. Freyalove goes to a deeper level to match individuals based on compatible personalities, which is key to forming healthy long-term relationships. By using a scientifically designed and a proven algorithm, Freyalove ensures your potential partners match you by more than a yardstick measurement. Not only that, there is a real person who does a sanity check of the matches after the matching algorithm kicks in. She acts as the unofficial “Match Maker” who ensures that the matches are compatible. Why? They are her friends. She knows them best! She knows what her friends like and dislike so that she is able to ensure that the compatibility is 99.9% accurate!</p>
<p>Do you both have personalities and approach life in a way that is truly compatible? By personality matching with a real person to do a sanity check, you get an extra level of assurance that there is an increased potential for a finding the One.</p>
<p>That’s what makes it great about Freyalove!</p>

<h2>How does FreyaLove compare to other gay/lesbian dating websites?</h2>

<p>First of all, FreyaLove is not a lesbian dating website. It sets us apart with the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We are the ONLY virtual match making website built for lesbians using a powerful matching algorithm and an unofficial “Match Maker” who cross-checks the matches</li>
	<li>We have the only personality test created specifically for the lesbian community unlike other sites that are created for heterosexuality couples</li>
	<li>Freyalove focuses on providing quality traits with more than the few default questions which every dating website does. She dwells into the deeper side of the individuals by understanding the core personalities with the help of a personality test which is created for single lesbians. Moreover, by using a powerful matching algorithm, it’s able to match individuals with the closest results followed by an unofficial “Match Maker” who is the mutual friend of 2 parties. She will then conduct a deeper level of verification ensuring that the matches are 99.9% matched</li>
	<li>A fun leaderboard for Top Match Makers with highest points earned</li>
	<li>We provide members with a refund option to give back to charities. “Refund or Donate” is an option for members who are not satisfied with Freyalove virtual match making service. The refund is given back to the charities listed on Freyalove</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does FreyaLove work?</h2>

<p>Freyalove is created for lesbians who desire to be match makers or existing match makers. The intention is to help their friends find better love and break their friends’ current dating patterns who fall prey to searching love in pubs or clubs where often quality love and happiness could be compromised. Such love is often short-termed and disastrous. Freyalove.com is via invitation only.</p>
<p>freyalove works by asking you fun physiology and background questions; specifically designed to understand your core personality as well as identify individuals with personalities who are best suited to match yours. Next, you complete your profile with less than 5 minute scenario tests. Our matching algorithm kicks in based on your personality and then your desired traits. Freyalove identifies your ideal matches and send them to your mutual friend who acts as the unofficial “Match Maker” who then conducts a sanity check to ensure 99.9% compatibility. This is to ensure a deeper level of compatibility assurance.</p>
<p>You log onto freyalove either with a valid freyalove username and password or Facebook login. Once logged in, you will start to create your profile by answering some fun and qualitative questionnaire. You will then invite your facebook friends to freyalove.com who are single and are trapped in unhappy relationships whom you believe need your helping hand. This is done out of passion for your friends and we believe in good karma. After your friends have joined freyalove.com, you act as the unofficial “Match Maker” receive notifications about the matches conducted by the matching algorithm. And, you will then perform the next level by filtering the matches based on your knowledge of your friends based on the type she likes and dislikes and personality. The filtered matches get sent to the friend’s inbox. The compatibility might not be 100% matched but at least 99.9%. Once you are satisfied with the filtered matches, you will send the pair a “New Date” for them to meet up. Also, you will send “New Message” for them to start a conversation.</p>
<p>You, as the Match Maker will be informed of the date set up between the pair.</p>

<h2>How is Freyalove different from an offline Match Making service?</h2>

<p>An offline Match Making agency only performs the mach making service for members living within the area or possibly within the country but that limits the rest of the population and other parts of the world. Even though Freyalove is servicing in some parts of the world, rest assured, she will be coming to your area soon. We do not wish to limit the limitless and to ensure there is fun and quality, we have a special feature that allows their mutual friends to play a part in the match making process. Freyalove is via invitation only at this point in time. Freyalove differentiates from an offline match making service in the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Offer globally (at a later stage so do stay tuned)</li>
	<li>The first virtual match making service ever made available for the lesbian community</li>
	<li>Your friend can vouch for your credibility to your suggested matches</li>
	<li>Your friend becomes your unofficial “Match Maker” who conducts a sanity check on the matches kicked off by the matching algorithm</li>
	<li>Your unofficial “Match Maker” does the preliminary work for you. She filters the suggested matches, introduces a pair of suggested matches, creates an event for them and creates an event for a pair regardless if they are a match or not. All you have to do is show up at the right time and place, and hopefully, magic happens from there</li>
	<li>It’s also for individuals who seek fun in a committed relationship</li>
</ul>
